Average best and worst case of an algorithim

Example 1 : Simple function with same order of growth for every input
Program : 
    int getSum(int arr[], int n){
        int sum = 0
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum = sum+arr[i]
        }
        return sum
    }

The best , average and worst case of this algorithim is N


Example 2 :  Multiple order of growth
Program : 
    int getSum(int arr[], int n){
        if (n%2 == 0) return 0; ( Due to buisnesss reasons )
        int sum = 0
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum = sum+arr[i]
        }
        return sum
    }

Best case is 👍 constant ( IF we got only even we are considering what is best for program)
Average case  Linear (Under the assumption that even and odd are equally likely)
worst case is also Linear


Most of the time we use "worst" case 
Best is someting  bogus we don't ever tell anyone the best case of program it is always considered the worst
